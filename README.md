# Vue TypeScript Examples
* Showcase TypeScript + Vue (bring types in from official Vue packages, etc)
* Dig deep into the Vue API and show examples from beginner to advanced
* Document the examples with verbose notes right in the code
* Explore Vue app structures

We'll tackle the low-hanging fruit first, the beginner and intermediate stuff, with a goal of adding advanced topics and examples.

## Get Started
* Clone the repository
* `yarn` to install dependencies
* `yarn start` to spin up the dev server

With the dev server open, navigate around and check the source code that matches with the examples, or just poke around the repository.

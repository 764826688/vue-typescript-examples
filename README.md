# Vue TypeScript Examples
The purpose of this repository is to dig deep into the Vue API and to work out how to integrate types correctly in TypeScript.

Only the lowest hanging fruit has been completed - advanced topics and examples will get added over time.

## Get Started

* `yarn` to install dependencies
* `yarn start` to spin up the dev server

With the dev server open, navigate around and check the source code that matches with the examples, or just poke around the repository.
